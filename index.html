        <h1>DARTH VADER</h1>
        <p>Once a heroic Jedi Knight, Darth Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force, became a Sith Lord, and led the Empire’s eradication of the Jedi Order.

        <h2>THE DARK TIMES</h2>
        <p>Vader quickly became a highly visible symbol of the Empire, serving as Palpatine’s fearsome enforcer.

Only a few guessed the truth – that Vader was the reborn Jedi Anakin Skywalker.</p>
